Before starting:

1: If there was any modification in custom.xacro or tips.xacro, they files must be updated in baxter_description folder
2: Ensure my version of joint_limits.yaml is in the moveit config
   This adds a few joint limits in baxter e0 and w0 to ensure the same arm pose and disabling inversion of whole arm
3: When turning on robot, run use_my_grippers.sh, uploads our current config to baxter.
   To verify, run rviz, there should be new tfs "X_gripper_Y_finger_inner" (4 of them)
4: If the sensors have been recconected, the sensors ID may need to be changed in the sensors.launch parameters
   This is in order to associate the right tf name with the correct sensor ID
5: If change of object, change value of R in expl code, max radius in cm of expl area

To start:

1: Roslaunch background.launch
2: Roslaunch planners.launch
3: Roslaunch sensors.launch
4: Ready to rosrun exploration codes
NOTE: If tripod or baxter was moved, we need to re-measure the exploration "center of coordinates"
   Run rviz once and place a finger tip on the exact center of the empty tripod base
   Check the location of tf in rviz, write down that number
   Update the values (in cm) in the Explore codes
5: The code stops when about to move to point, and when contact location is measured. In order to help with supervised exploration.
   If explorations go well, you can make it 100% automatic by changing the variable "manual" to "false"
   MAKE SURE SOMEONE IS SUPERVISING BAXTER AND STOP THE BACKGROUND LAUNCH NODES IF THE MOVEMENT IS WEIRD
6: Result will be found in an exploration folder somewhere
