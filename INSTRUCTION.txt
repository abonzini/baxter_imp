Before starting:

1: If there was any modification in custom.xacro or tips.xacro, they files must be updated in baxter_description folder
2: Ensure my version of joint_limits.yaml is in the moveit config
   This adds a few joint limits in baxter e0 and w0 to ensure the same arm pose and disabling inversion of whole arm
3: When turning on robot, run use_my_grippers.sh, uploads our current config to baxter.
   To verify, run rviz, there should be new tfs "X_gripper_Y_finger_inner" (4 of them)
4: If the sensors have been recconected, the sensors ID may need to be changed in the sensors.launch parameters
   This is in order to associate the right tf name with the correct sensor ID
5: If change of object, change value of R in expl code, max radius in cm of expl area

Calibration:
- You can try if you want, to touch a point in the object with both tip and inner and compare the tf in rviz
  This in order to see we have the right model.
- IMPORTANT: If tripod has been touched (i.e. object changed or accident), please measure the new "center of reference" since soemtimes it can move by up to 1cm or more
  To do this, measure opposite sides of object (or the orange base) and calculate the avg
  The value needs to be modified in the ExploreNoSym.py origin variable in line 24 ( use CM!)

To start:

1: Roslaunch background.launch
2: Roslaunch planners.launch
3: Roslaunch sensors.launch
4: Ready to rosrun exploration codes
5: Make sure to stop execution if baxter is about to have an accident!
6: Results will be found in an exploration folder in catkin_ws called exploration_auto_implicit.
   If multiple experiments were performed, there will be many subfolders with each experiment.
